# Introduction

Youâ€™ve found the Unofficial Discord User Documentation! These pages are dedicated to showing you all the ways that you can use Discord to make cool stuff.

All of our [documentation is on GitHub](https://github.com/discord-userdoccers/discord-userdoccers) and we <3 corrections and improvements!

## Bots and Apps

Bots and apps are not the focus of this documentation set, users are! If thats what your looking for head over to [Discord's Offical Documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)

Discord offers an open API to serve requests for users, bots and OAuth2 integrations. So whether youâ€™re making your own `!dmall` command or looking to [`Aggregate Emails`](/topics/oauth2/), weâ€™ve got you covered.

So go do it! Go! Go [make an account](/resources/auth) and do something awesome.
