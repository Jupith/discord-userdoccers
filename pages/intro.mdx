# Introduction

You’ve found the Unofficial Discord User API Documentation! These pages are dedicated to showing you all the ways that you can use Discord to make cool stuff.

All of our [documentation is on GitHub](https://github.com/discord-userdoccers/discord-userdoccers) and we <3 corrections and improvements!

## ⚠️ Note

This documentation is not affiliated with or endorsed by Discord in any way. It is a community effort to document the API as it is used by user accounts, and is not an official source of information. Automating user accounts is against the platform Terms of Service, so just a heads up: doing so unsafely might get you banned.

## Scope

Bots and interactions are not the focus of this documentation set, users are! If interactions are what you’re looking for head over to [Discord’s Official Documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).

Discord offers an open API to serve requests for users, bots, and OAuth2 integrations. So whether you’re making your own `!dmall` command or looking to [`Aggregate Emails`](/topics/oauth2/), we’ve got you covered.

So go do it! Go! Go [make an account](/resources/auth) and do something awesome.
